NTU is also placed 1st amongst the world’s best young universities. With its 3,800 teaching and research staff, NTU provides high-quality global education to about 33,000 undergraduate and postgraduate students from Singapore and across the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The university needed to design a stable, flexible, high-performance, scalable, and cost- effective cloud infrastructure platform that allows public and private computing resources. They partnered with Red Hat to build the software infrastructure platform on open source Red Hat Cloud Infrastructure, is running on Intel Xeon processor-based servers and NetApp SnapMirror for storage.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;software-and-services&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Red Hat® Cloud Infrastructure&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Red Hat Enterprise Linux® OpenStack® Platform&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Red Hat CloudForms&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;NetApp SnapMirror Data Replication&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;hardware&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Intel Xeon processor E5-4650L based SGI servers&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;NetApp Data Storage Systems&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;customer-since&quot;:&quot;2009&quot;,&quot;customer-representative-quote&quot;:&quot;With Red Hat Cloud Infrastructure, we can do in 30 minutes what used to take at least a day.

Therefore, the university needed computing resources with unlimited capacity, platform abstraction, and the ability to achieve economies of scale to cater to the requirements of researchers and students.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The university also needed to maximize resource utilization and reduce the unnecessary overhead costs from manual provisioning and approval processes. And it needed to cope with unanticipated compute demand, which is typical of research and HPC. The university had to find a way to move work- load very quickly from NTU to Amazon Web Services (AWS) to tap its elastic compute resources via AWS Direct Connect while, at the same time, preserving and ensuring data outside of the public cloud.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition to these requirements, the infrastructure solution needed to allow for:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Users to affordably set up remote disaster recovery for data and selected services.  &lt;li&gt;High performance I/O and network performance for more responsive virtual machines with latency close to physical machines.  &lt;li&gt;Unified management of resources that can reside within HPCC’s premises or in an external cloud.  &lt;li&gt;End users to be able to perform basic self-service functions for faster deployment and reduced admin overhead.  &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;In order to achieve these requirements, the HPCC team decided that it needed a solution based on open source. “We needed a secure, open solution that was able to implement the hybrid IT cloud architecture seamlessly,” said Professor Yeng Chai Soh, founding director of HPCC at NTU.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Solution&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;NTU chose Red Hat Cloud Infrastructure to build the private, on-premise cloud within NTU. The solu- tion consists of three Red Hat products: Red Hat CloudForms, Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We evaluated several vendors and we found Red Hat to have one of the most versatile and complete solutions in Red Hat Cloud Infrastructure,” said Professor Soh.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The virtualization component provides the functionality needed for traditional scale-up workloads. Using Intel® Xeon® processor E5-4650L-8C-based servers allowed maximum flexibility to stack up compute density for the Red Hat Cloud Infrastructure. The Intel® Xeon® processor E5-based server platform also allowed Red Hat Cloud Infrastructure to enable efficient usage of energy even for com- pute-intensive workloads.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform handles the scale-out workloads. Red Hat CloudForms ensures unified management across the technologies, as well as workloads running on AWS. Since AWS uses Intel® Xeon® processor E5-based solutions extensively, integration was seamless between private and public clouds running on Red Hat Cloud Infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;NetApp SnapMirror also enabled NTU to replicate volume from their private NetApp storage to another NetApp storage, which is linked to AWS via AWS-Direct-Connect facilities. SnapMirror mirrors data to one or more network filers at high speed over LAN or WAN connections. This allows NTU’s data to be written and replicated in their remote NetApp storage, while allowing them to tap AWS for its elastic computing resources. Being the only AWS certified private network storage vendor, and a provider for enterprise grade storage with strong technical expertise, NetApp was a natural choice for storage by NTU.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;NTU engaged Red Hat Consulting and the support that comes with a Red Hat Cloud Infrastructure subscription. Red Hat Consulting helped to architect the solution, ensuring that it was well-inte- grated with NTU’s existing infrastructure. The engagement also provided subject matter expertise in emerging technologies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Results&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;With Red Hat’s solutions and support, NTU has seamlessly integrated a private cloud with a public cloud while keeping the data local within its internal storage. The new hybrid cloud IT architecture allows the university to reap the benefits of elastic computing, and integrate both public and private cloud resources. The seamless integration between Red Hat, Intel, and NetApp into AWS made it pos- sible for NTU to architect this innovative cloud model, which can be adopted by other academic institutions for their cloud needs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since its implementation, the new open and hybrid cloud infrastructure has provided NTU with sub- stantial performance improvements, as well as time and cost savings. For example, users can now quickly access resources through the service catalogue when needed, as opposed to manually provi- sioning virtual machines and constantly monitoring resources. NTU now has the flexibility to manage data volume spikes for both the cloud and datacenter with its automated resource provisioning.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“With Red Hat Cloud Infrastructure, we can do in 30 minutes what used to take at least one day,” said Professor Soh. “With a single user interface, our users can access a seamless self-service portal to manage resources from both their on-premise, private cloud service, as well as AWS.”&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;last-page-content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Because Red Hat Cloud Infrastructure allows users to provision independently, and its self-service portal is rich in analytics and reports, administrators benefit from time savings, which translates to cost savings. This frees up resources so that the team can focus on more strategic projects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Architecting our solution with Red Hat has allowed NTU to showcase innovative solutions, which can positively impact day-to-day research initiatives globally, and can be applied and adopted by research agencies and business entities with specific needs for real-time management and resourc- ing,” said Professor Soh. “Red Hat Cloud Infrastructure provided a cost-efficient, scalable, and inno- vative way to allow unified management of a hybrid environment.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Going forward, NTU plans to further exploit the rich features and openness of Red Hat CloudForms and Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform to develop a single sign-on module for federated sign-on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Professor Soh’s advice to those considering a large-scale deployment is to take a phased approach and start with a pilot to sort out any potential issues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Take advantage of open standards and open source to ensure interoperability and prevent lock-in with single vendors,” said Professor Soh. “We were able to build a long-term and collaborative part- nership with Red Hat — we didn’t just buy a solution. In order to achieve a large-scale deployment, make sure you work with a trusted partner.”&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;about-red-hat&quot;:&quot;&lt;h1&gt;ABOUT RED HAT&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Red Hat is the world’s leading provider of open source solutions, using a community-powered approach to provide reliable and high-performing cloud, virtualization, storage, Linux, and middleware technologies.
