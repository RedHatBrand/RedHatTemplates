RedHatTemplates - Booths Notes
==============================

Booth templates' dimensions are currently half (1/2) of their original dimensions. To bring them back to their original dimensions, subtract 12mm from their existing dimensions and multiply them by 2. Ex:

```
width: 1012mm -> (1012mm - 12mm) * 2 -> 2000mm + 12mm = 2012mm
```

12mm is the bleed and slug of all print files. It should not be multiplied by 2 along with the print dimension.
