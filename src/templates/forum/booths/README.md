RedHatTemplates - Booths Notes
==============================

Booth templates' dimensions are currently half of their original dimensions. To resize it, subtract 12mm from their dimension and multiply the subtracted dimension by 2. Ex:

```
width: 1012mm -> 1012mm - 12mm * 2 = 2000mm + 12mm = 2012mm
```

12mm is the bleed and slug of all print files. It should not be multiplied by 2 along with the print dimension.
